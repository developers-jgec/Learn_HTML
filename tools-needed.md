Welcome to world of Web Development.

To get started with Web development all we need is a Web Browser and a text editor.
There are many of them available but the popular and most used ones are mentioned below.

* The best choice amongst Web Browser are:
  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

* One can use built-in text editors to create an HTML source file or use some custom text editors:
  - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  - [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
